            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on related to movies and quizzes:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Famous Movie Quotes App</h2>
            <p>This project is a fun and interactive application that allows users to explore and guess famous movie quotes. The app features a quiz mode, a random quote generator, and a section to learn interesting trivia about the movies and characters behind the quotes.</p>


            <h2>2. Movie Recommendation System</h2>
            <p>A web application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It utilizes an API to pull in movie data and offers personalized recommendations based on the genres and actors the user likes.</p>

            <h2>3. Movie Poster Generator</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created an app that allows users to create their own movie posters by uploading images and adding text. It includes custom templates for users to choose from.</p>
